Thanks for browsing my code , this is responseve Draggable canvas slider with navbar 

-in order to use the code in your project you have to put this slider in iframe and hide the scroll because this slider fits all the screen 

this slider was built by using java script Library https://unpkg.com/panzoom@8.7.3/dist/panzoom.min.js
